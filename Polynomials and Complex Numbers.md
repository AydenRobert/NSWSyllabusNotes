We know that in a quadratic, x can have anywhere from 0 to 2 answers. We can check how many answers by checking the discriminant ($\Delta$).

Where $\Delta=b^2-4ac$ If $f(x)=ax^2+bx+c$
If $\Delta>0$ there are 2 answers
If $\Delta=0$ there is 1 answer
If $\Delta<0$ there are no answers

We know this is the case because $\Delta$ falls under a square root, so if it's negative value, that doesn't exist. But what did we say $\sqrt{-1}$ is equal to?

Now with complex numbers we can say this, for every polynomial, amount of roots is equal to the degree of the polynomial (when counting double/triple/... roots as multiple).

If all the coefficients of a polynomial are real and one of the roots is a complex number, then the conjugate of that complex number is also a root. 
Consider $ax^2+bx=c$ when $a.b.c \ \epsilon \ \mathbb{R}$
If $x_1=z$ then $x_2=\bar{z}$

But polynomials don't have to have real coefficients, here are some more ways we can factorise and find roots:

### 1) Testing a root
We can test roots in any polynomial by inputting it into the function, if the result is zero then it is a function
If $x-1=0$ is a root of $P(x)=x^2-1$ then:
$$P(1) = (1)^2-1$$
$$P(1)=0$$
This is the same with complex roots, let's see this.
If $z-1-i=0$ is a root of $P(z)=z^2-2z+2$ then:
$$P(1+i)=(1+i)^2-2(1+i)+2$$
$$P(1+i)=1^2+2i+i^2-2-2i+2$$
$$P(1+i)=1+2i-1-2-2i+2$$
$$P(1+i)=0$$
