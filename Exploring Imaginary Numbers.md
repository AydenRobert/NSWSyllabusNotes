As we know the square root of a negative number isn't possible as squaring a number will never end up in a negative answer. But what if there was? What if there was a number that could do this? This question is the basis of Complex Numbers.

$$ Assume \ that \ i = \sqrt-1$$
Knowing this fact, we can also gather the following:
$i^2=-1$
$i^3=-i$
$i^4=1$
$i^5=i$
The pattern continues.

To write an imaginary number you do it as so.
$$f(x) \times i$$
Where f(x) can be anything, a number, a pronumeral, e, so on.
