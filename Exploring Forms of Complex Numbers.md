#MEXT2 #ComplexNumbers 

Complex Number can be expressed in 3 different forms.

The first thing to note is that the letters z and w are the most commonly used pronumerals to denote complex numbers.

## General Form
General Form (a.k.a Cartesion Form), can be thought of expressing complex numbers in it's real and imaginary components seperately.
$$z=x+iy$$
Where x is the real (horizontal) component and iy is the imaginary (vertical component)
## Polar Form
Polar Form (ModArg Form) is arguably the most useful form as it uses sine and cosine to determine the angle of the complex number and allows for the use of exact values when working with them. 
$$z=r(cos\theta+isin\theta)$$
Where r is the magnitude of a line drawn from 0 to the point and $\theta$ is the angle (measured from $+x$ anticlockwise).

Also, to refer to the Magnitude we use the term **Modulus** and to refer to the angle we use the term **Argument**. Hence the name, ModArg.
## Exponential Form
Exponential Form gets it's name from the exponential function which is commonly written the same way as the trancendential number e.
$$z=re^{i\theta}$$
The letters mean the same thing seen in polar form.

## Examples
Here is an example of a complex number mapped to a 2d plane called the Argand Diagram. The Argand looks a lot like the Cartesion Plane and we do use some of the same terminology, x maps to the real axis and y maps the the imaginary axis. 

(Please note that this is not the same as the input/output cartesion plane we already know. To map Complex numbers in an input/output way you'd need 4 dimensions.)

As you can see, this complex number is sitting at 1 on the real axis and 1 on the imaginary axis. So it would be:
$$z=1+i$$
To convert it to Polar Form, we need to create a triangle out of these two lines, so we can find $r$ (the hypotenuse) and $\theta$ (the angle). In this case we can take it straight from the formula sheet.

So let's apply these values into the Polar Form.
$$z=\sqrt{2}(cos\frac{\pi}{4}+isin\frac{\pi}{4})$$
And the Exponential Form.
$$z=\sqrt{2}e^{i\frac{\pi}{4}}$$
