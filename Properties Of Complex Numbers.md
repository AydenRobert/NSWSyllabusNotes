#MEXT2 #ComplexNumbers 
When referring to a complex number, you can refer to their specific properties:

## Real and Imaginary

$Re(z)$ refers to the real part ($x$).

$Im(z)$ refers to the imaginary part ($y$).

$Arg(z)$ refers to the argument/angle ($\theta$).

$|z|$ refers to the modulus/magnitude ($r$).

## The Conjugate
Every complex number has what is called a **Conjugate**, these are useful to know especially when working with fractions. To get the Conjugate, you $\times$ the y part by $-1$. The notation for the conjugate is a line over the top of your complex number ( $\bar{}$ ).
$$\text{If} \ z=x+iy$$
$$\text{Then} \ \bar{z}=x-iy$$
## De Moivre's Theorem
De Moivre's Theorem allows for a very easy way to multiply complex numbers.
$$\text{If} \ z=r_1(\cos\theta_1+i\sin\theta_1)$$
$$w=r_2(\cos\theta_2+i\sin\theta_2)$$
$$\text{Then} \ zw = r_1r_2(\cos(\theta_1+\theta_2)+i\sin(\theta_1+\theta_2))$$
$$\therefore r_1e^{i\theta_1}\times r_2e^{i\theta_2}=r_1r_2e^{i(\theta_1+\theta_2)}$$
